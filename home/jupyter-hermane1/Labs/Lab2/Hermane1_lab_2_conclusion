## Conclusion 

## (1)  ##
## I did this experment using a similar setup to the one you used in the demo, for the plank I used a wood shelf that was
## sanded down. I used physics toolbox to record my angle, and three diffrent textbooks to create the angle. I recorded the 
## time on my phone and used a ruler to release the toy car. At the base I had a box of tools to break the impact. I stoped
## recording time when I heard the car hit the box instead of watching it. I also used a meter tape to make sure board was
## correct length. Experment was done on my kitchen table.

## (2)  ##
## The most challenging part of the lab for me was getting the car to run straight down the board (I found no trick 
## for this instead just restarted if it fell off), hitting stop at the right time(didnt watch car instead i listened 
## for when it hit base), and releasing the car consistantly(used a ruler instead of my fingers). 

## The most chalanging part of the lab would be staying consistant with the car.
## Also using python for the data has been very chalanging and Im not even sure i have done it correctly but I very much enjoyed
## trying to figure it out and watching how it could be used prectially. Even  if iv messed up this code I still feel rather 
## pround of it. 

## my values of g are off and my standered diviation is a bit high, I am not sure if this is due to any mistakes I made in 
## the code or if it is from human error in my experment.
      
   ## Average value of g from the first inclination angle = 9.4539046809797 Standard deviation of the measurement is = 1.53
   ## Average value of g from the second inclination angle = 9.949545213006669 Standard deviation of the measurement is = 0.62
   ## Average value of g from the third inclination angle = 9.847728459986854 Standard deviation of the measurement is = 0.82
